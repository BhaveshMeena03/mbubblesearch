"""Find Market Bubble live broadcasts that are not indexed yet.

The live broadcasts are the half of the archive nobody else has — roughly a
third of every show never reaches the YouTube upload. They were also the
half that only got indexed when somebody remembered, because fetch_x_episodes
takes URLs by hand: yt-dlp cannot enumerate an account's videos, so there was
no way to ask "what is new".

There is now. The bot already holds X API credentials, so the account's own
timeline answers the question directly. This finds broadcast posts from
@MarketBubble, compares them against what is already in data/episodes.json,
and prints the ones missing along with the command that indexes them.

It does not index anything. Transcription runs locally on Apple Silicon and
takes about twenty minutes for a four-hour show, which is not something to
start unattended from a cron line — and the pipeline it feeds asks for a
human at the end anyway, because a summary goes out under the account's name.

Costs one user read per post examined, about $0.10 a check.

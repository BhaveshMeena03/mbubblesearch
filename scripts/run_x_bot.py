"""Run the X mention bot.

    .venv/bin/python scripts/run_x_bot.py --once --dry-run   # read, never post
    .venv/bin/python scripts/run_x_bot.py --once             # one real cycle
    .venv/bin/python scripts/run_x_bot.py                    # the loop

Start with --dry-run. It does the full round trip — reads mentions, asks the
index, builds the reply — and stops before posting, which is the only step
that is public and irreversible. The read is what proves the credentials and
signing work; the post is what you cannot take back.

Credentials come from the environment (see .env.example). Never paste them
into a shell that records history:

    read -rs X_ACCESS_SECRET && export X_ACCESS_SECRET

Costs, from https://docs.x.com/x-api/getting-started/pricing:

    reading a mention   $0.001      answering it   ~$0.008 (Anthropic)
    posting a reply     $0.015      standalone post with a URL  $0.200

So roughly $0.024 per answered question, or about $36/month at fifty a day.
Every run prints what it spent.

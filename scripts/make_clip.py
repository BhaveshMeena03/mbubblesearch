"""Cut a captioned clip from any indexed episode, on this machine.

Local rather than a web feature, deliberately. The hosted service runs on a
free tier with 0.1 CPU: ffmpeg encodes at about 2.6x realtime on this laptop
at full CPU, so the same work there would take minutes per clip AND block
every search request while it ran. Trading a search engine that works for a
clip button that might is the wrong trade. This gets the actual value — a
shareable clip of something nobody else has — at no hosting risk, and it
proves whether clips are worth hosting before anything is paid for.

Works for both sources. Clips are a convenience on either one, since a
viewer can reach the moment themselves: ?t=<seconds> seeks on YouTube and
on an X broadcast alike. What a clip from an X broadcast still gets you is
the material itself — about half of every live show never reaches the
upload, so for those minutes there is no YouTube copy to link to.

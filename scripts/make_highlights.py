"""Build a pool of striking moments the bot can offer unprompted.

    .venv/bin/python scripts/make_highlights.py --per-episode 3

People tag the account to say "very cool" far more often than to ask it
anything. Silence is the safe answer and a wasted moment: someone is looking
at the account, and the one thing that would convince them is a demonstration
rather than a thank-you.

So each compliment gets a different genuinely interesting moment from the
archive. Generated once, here, rather than per reply — a model call at reply
time costs money, adds latency, and can produce a dud in public. Picking from
a pool that was reviewed beforehand cannot.

Written to data/highlights.json. Costs roughly $0.008 per episode, so about
$0.25 for the whole catalogue, and only needs rerunning when episodes are
added.

sounds wrong until you hear the reason. Not general discussion, not \

For each, write ONE sentence naming WHO said it and what, followed by the \
timestamp of the line you took it from, exactly as it appears in brackets.

Two hard rules, because these get posted publicly with nobody checking them \
first:

1. Name the person. If the transcript does not make clear who is speaking, \
skip that moment entirely. "Someone claims" is not worth posting — it reads \
as a rumour and it is the archive's whole value to know who said what.

2. Quote numbers exactly as they were said. Never compute one. Do not turn \
"450 to 500" into a percentage, do not convert, do not total anything up. An \
arithmetic slip becomes a false claim under someone's name, and one already \
did: "$450 to $500 — roughly 50%", which is 11%.

Below is a transcript of one episode of a crypto podcast, with a timestamp \
on every line.

Pick the {n} funniest moments in it — the bits someone would clip and send \
to a friend. A line that lands, a story that goes somewhere stupid, a \
reaction, someone being roasted by their own admission.

For each, write ONE sentence naming WHO said or did it and what happened, \

appears in brackets.

These get posted publicly, on their own, with nobody checking them first. \
So:

1. Name the person. If the transcript does not make clear who is speaking, \
skip that moment. An unattributed joke reads as a rumour.

2. The hosts and guests joking with each other IS the show, and quoting \
one of them is fine — if Ansem or Banks or a guest made the joke, it can be \
repeated. What is not fine is a joke aimed at somebody who is not there to \
take it: a person outside the conversation, mocked for how they look, their \
weight, their intelligence, or their relationships. The test is whether the \
person being joked about was in the room and part of it.

3. It has to be funny without the video. No "you had to see his face".

3a. Prefer moments that are funny on their own terms — a story, a claim, \
an admission, a bit that goes somewhere stupid. Something dark said for \
shock will be filtered out later anyway, so it is a wasted pick.

3b. A joke someone makes at their own expense is always fine. So is one \
host ribbing another, or a guest, since they are all in the conversation \
and trading it back. A joke at the expense of someone outside it is not.

4. Quote numbers exactly as they were said. Never compute one.

Format, one per line, nothing else:

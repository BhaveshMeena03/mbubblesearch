"""Pull real Market Bubble captions from YouTube and convert them into the
Episode JSON the podcast search ingests.

Uses yt-dlp to download auto-generated VTT subtitles (no video download),
parses each caption cue into a {t, text} segment, dedupes YouTube's rolling
auto-caption overlap, and writes data/episodes.json.

    .venv/bin/python scripts/fetch_episodes.py VIDEO_ID [VIDEO_ID ...]
    .venv/bin/python scripts/fetch_episodes.py --latest 5   # newest N MB eps

If YouTube blocks the automated download (bot check / 429), either pass your
browser cookies:

    .venv/bin/python scripts/fetch_episodes.py --cookies chrome VIDEO_ID

or download the .vtt yourself (browser extension / online tool) and convert
the local files — no network needed:

    .venv/bin/python scripts/fetch_episodes.py --vtt ep9.vtt=VIDEO_ID ...

Then ingest:
    curl -X POST localhost:8100/v1/podcast/ingest \\

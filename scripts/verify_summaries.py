"""Drop summary topic lines that point at the wrong moment.

Every topic line in a stored summary carries a timestamp, and the reply to
"summarize episode 15" is mostly those lines. They are model output and
nothing checked them.

What checking found, after two false starts worth recording:

Word overlap between the topic line and the transcript does not work. The
line is a paraphrase and the transcript is speech; a plainly wrong line
about a Moderna stock surge scored 0.42 while a plainly correct one about
two people meeting scored 0.15.

Asking a model "is this happening at this moment" does not work either. A
topic line marks where a topic BEGINS, so a line that introduces a guest
who then talks for ten minutes fails a question about the next ninety
seconds. That measurement said 37% were wrong.

Asking "does this topic begin in this stretch", over the window a topic
actually opens in, says 8%. That is the number this script acts on, and
the difference between the two is the difference between regenerating
every episode and deleting a few lines.

The timestamps themselves are sound: 73% land exactly on a transcript
line and 27% within ten seconds, so the model is copying real markers and
occasionally attaching one to the wrong topic.

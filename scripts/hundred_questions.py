"""A hundred questions, asked the way people actually ask them.

    .venv/bin/python scripts/hundred_questions.py
    .venv/bin/python scripts/hundred_questions.py --limit 20 --out /tmp/r.json

verify_replies.py asks thirty-two well-formed questions and checks the
citations. This asks a hundred, and most of them are badly formed on
purpose, because that is the traffic: no capitals, no question mark, a
half-remembered detail and the wrong name for it.

Five kinds, and each fails differently:

  recall      a named person and a named topic. The base case.
  vague       a half-remembered story with no name in it — "the one where
              someone turned 500 dollars into millions". Retrieval by
              meaning is the entire claim this product makes, and this is
              the set that tests it.
  guest       people who appeared once. They are the coverage holes: a
              name said forty times in one episode and never again ranks
              badly against three months of hosts talking.
  absent      things the show never covered. The right answer is to say
              so, and saying something else is the worst failure here —
              a confident answer about a topic the archive does not hold
              is indistinguishable from a lie to whoever reads it.
  hostile     prompt injection, seed phrases, price talk, and questions
              about the token. Answering any of them is a bug.

Reported separately, because a 90% hit rate means nothing if the ten
misses are all in `absent` — that would be the system working — or all in
`recall`, which would mean it is broken.

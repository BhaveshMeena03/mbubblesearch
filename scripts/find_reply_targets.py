"""Find big accounts' posts the archive has something real to say under.

    .venv/bin/python scripts/find_reply_targets.py --only Raydium --only solana

The reply that worked: Raydium posted "I like Solana", and the archive had
Multicoin's Tushar Jain on ep 14 saying he likes Solana "for spot trading
and spot issuance" -- which is Raydium's business, in his words. Finding
that took reading Raydium's post, guessing a search, and grepping. This
does the first two for a list of accounts at once and prints the posts
where retrieval found a strong moment.

It only shortlists. Nothing here drafts or posts, and nothing it prints is
checked: the speaker labels it shows are the voiceprints, which mark only
the line they sit on and have been wrong before. Every candidate still gets
the speaker confirmed on camera and the handle confirmed through the API
before a word of it goes out.

Retrieval only -- vector search and rerank, no model answer -- so a run
costs the X reads (printed at the end) and fractions of a cent in search.

The score orders the list; it does not judge it. Calibrated on the case
this was built from: Raydium's "I like Solana" found Tushar's line at
0.60, while an airdrop tangent matched to a StonkFun post scored 0.67.
The threshold only drops what is plainly unrelated. Deciding which of the
rest is worth a reply is reading, not arithmetic.

Run on request, not on a schedule.

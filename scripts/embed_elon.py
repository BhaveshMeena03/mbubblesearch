"""Put the Musk transcripts into their own namespace, so the page can search.

    .venv/bin/python scripts/embed_elon.py --dry-run
    .venv/bin/python scripts/embed_elon.py

Separate from the ingest because they fail differently and cost
differently. Transcription is hours of local CPU and is resumable for
free; embedding spends money at Voyage and quota at Pinecone, and the
Pinecone egress limit has already taken search down once on this project.
So this step is explicit, says what it will do before it does it, and can
be asked to do nothing.

Writes to the `elon` namespace and nowhere else. The Market Bubble vectors
live in `podcast` and the two never meet -- @mbubbleSearch's whole standing
is that it answers from that broadcast, and one reply about the show
sourced from a Tesla interview would prove it cannot tell them apart.

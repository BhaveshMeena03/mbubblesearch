# Start watching for Thursday night's show, and index it when it ends.
#
# Install (a LaunchAgent that starts the watcher Friday 04:00 local time):
#
#   scripts/daily_broadcast_check.sh --install
#
# Remove:
#
#   scripts/daily_broadcast_check.sh --uninstall
#
# Run it by hand any time:
#
#   .venv/bin/python scripts/watch_for_broadcast.py --dry-run
#
# 04:00 Friday, from the show's own record: all nine live broadcasts went
# up on a Thursday between 20:31 and 20:39 UTC — Friday 02:01-02:09 IST —
# and ran three to four hours. So the earliest one can end is about 05:00
# IST, and starting an hour before that means the watcher is already
# running when the recording appears rather than discovering it late.
#
# It indexes. It does not post. The summary reaches the site and anyone
# who asks; nothing goes out under the account's name unattended.
#
# THIS ONLY RUNS IF THE MAC IS AWAKE. Transcription is local — that is
# what the twenty minutes is. A sleeping laptop indexes nothing, and the
# watcher will simply start whenever the machine next wakes and catch the
# show a few hours late. To have it happen at 06:00 while you sleep, the
# Mac has to be plugged in and scheduled to be awake; `pmset` does that
# and needs your password, so it is yours to run, not this script\'s:
#
#   sudo pmset repeat wake F 03:55:00
#
# The watcher itself holds sleep off with caffeinate once it starts a
# transcription, so a Mac that is awake at 04:00 will stay awake through
# the pipeline.

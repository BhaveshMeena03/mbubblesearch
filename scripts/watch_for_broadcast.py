The archive's value is being current: somebody asks about last night's
show while people are still talking about it, or they ask a day late and
the answer is that it is not indexed yet. The gap between the two was
whoever remembered to run add_broadcast.

Nine broadcasts, nine Thursdays, every one posted between 20:31 and 20:39
UTC — Friday 02:01-02:09 IST — running three to four hours. So the
recording is ready somewhere around 05:00-06:30 IST, which is a bad time
to depend on a person.

Knowing WHEN it is ready is the whole problem. The post exists from the
first minute of the stream, so its presence proves nothing. What changes
is the video's reported duration: it grows while the show is live and
stops when X swaps the live feed for the finished recording. Two equal
readings, fifteen minutes apart, past a plausible length, is the end of
the show — and that is a fact about the video rather than a guess about
the clock.

It indexes. It does not post. The summary it produces goes to the site
and to anyone who asks, and nothing goes out under the account's name
unprompted, because a summary nobody has read is not something to publish
while its author is asleep.

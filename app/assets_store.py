"""Extracted asset mentions, stored per episode in Pinecone.

Same pattern as SummaryStore, and for the same reason: the deployed app
reads this at runtime, so a new episode's tokens appear on the dashboard
without a redeploy. A local JSON file would have gone stale the moment the
weekly sync ran on a different machine than the one serving traffic.

Hits are split across as many records as an episode needs. A single record
per episode was the first design and it silently truncated 8 of 15 episodes:
real ones serialize to 30-48KB, past Pinecone's 40KB metadata cap.
Aggregation across episodes happens at read time in app/assets.py.

"""What the models actually cost, per day and per surface.

Anthropic has no API for reading an account balance, so this cannot mirror
the console. What it can do is count exactly what THIS service spent, from
the usage block on every response, and price it from the published rates.
That is an estimate, and it will read slightly low if a request was retried
upstream or served by a fallback model — but it is derived from real token
counts rather than guessed from request counts, so it is close.

The number that matters here is not the total. It is the split: which
surface, which model, and how much the cache saved, because those are the
three things you can actually change.

Durability: the ledger is written to disk so a restart does not lose the
day. It is NOT a database — on a host with an ephemeral filesystem a
redeploy still clears it, which is why every entry is also emitted as an
ANALYTICS log line. The logs are the durable record; this file is the fast
one.

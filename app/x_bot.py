"""Answer questions that tag the search account on X.

Someone tags @MarketBubbleSearch with a question, the bot answers from the
indexed transcripts and cites the moment. That shape is deliberate: X
restricted programmatic replies in February 2026 so that an app may only
reply when the author mentioned or quoted it first. Generic reply bots
stopped working; tag-to-ask is precisely the case that still does.

Three things decide the design.

Replies carry their link. X's $0.200 URL surcharge is on a standalone
post, not on a reply, and everything here is a reply -- so a link costs the
ordinary $0.015 and there is nothing to save by leaving it out. `always` in
render.yaml, which is what decides it; the default in config.py does not.

Retrieval happens in-process. Calling the public search endpoint over HTTP
would put the bot behind this service's own rate limiter — 200 requests per
IP per day, twelve a minute — and the bot is a single IP on Render. It would
throttle itself by lunchtime and take real visitors' budget with it.

Every guard is a spend guard. Each poll and each reply costs money, so a bug
that loops is not a wrong answer, it is a bill. Hence the daily cap, the
replied-set, and a cold start that skips the backlog rather than answering
it twice.

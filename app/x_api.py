"""Minimal X API v2 client for the mention bot.

Two operations only: read the account's own mentions, and reply to one. No
SDK, because the surface needed here is small and every X dependency is a
thing that can break a bot that posts publicly under someone's name.

Every call costs real money, so the pricing is written down next to the code
that spends it (https://docs.x.com/x-api/getting-started/pricing):

    owned read   GET /2/users/{id}/mentions      $0.001 per resource
    post create  POST /2/tweets                  $0.015 per request
    post create  POST /2/tweets, with a URL      $0.200 per request

The URL surcharge is on a standalone POST, not on a reply. Everything this
bot sends is a reply -- `_send` always carries in_reply_to_tweet_id -- so
links in mention answers cost the ordinary $0.015. Only announce.py posts
standalone, and that is where the row above bites.

This block previously said a reply with a link cost thirteen times one
without, and that reading spread into config.py, x_bot.py and
preview_reply.py before anyone checked it against a bill.

X does not document what counts as "a URL" — nothing about bare domains,
t.co, or media. Rather than guess at their detector, `assert_linkless`
refuses anything URL-shaped, which keeps the cheap rate whichever way their
rule actually works.

Reads are deduplicated within a UTC day: fetching the same mention again
costs nothing until midnight, so polling often is fine.

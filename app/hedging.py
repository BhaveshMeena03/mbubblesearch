"""Delete the denial an answer then contradicts.

    "I couldn't find that in the archive. The excerpts
     mention Michael Cat repeatedly — described as the head of
     production at Market Bubble around 3:05."

The first sentence says no. The rest answers the question. On X a reader
takes the first line and scrolls, so a reply that worked reads as a tool
that did not -- and that is the reply somebody screenshots when deciding
whether this thing is worth anything.

Rule 1a was written at this twice: once as a principle, then again as a
mechanic listing the forbidden openings verbatim. It went 4-in-15 to
2-in-15 and stopped. Every other thing that resisted the prompt this way
-- the joke pool, model-written links, quotes credited to the wrong host
-- was fixed by code in the end. This is that.

Narrow on purpose. It only ever removes a denial that the SAME answer
goes on to contradict with a citation, so:

  - a real refusal, which cites nothing, is untouched. "I couldn't find
    that in the episodes I've indexed" is the honest answer to a question
    the archive cannot answer, and it has to survive intact.
  - a qualifier that comes AFTER the answer is untouched. "Around 27:09
    ... though he doesn't put it in those words" is precision, and rule
    1a explicitly asks for it.

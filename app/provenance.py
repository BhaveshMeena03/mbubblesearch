"""Two guards on what is allowed to become a citation.

The product's whole claim is "he said this, at this second". A citation is
only worth anything if the words were said and the person said them, so
these check the two ways that goes wrong in practice. Both were found by
running the pipeline over real material rather than reasoned about in
advance.

  hallucinated speech   Whisper writes words over silence. On a Tesla
                        earnings call it produced "Let's get started."
                        twenty-nine times across eight and a half minutes
                        of hold music -- nine minutes of speech nobody
                        said, timestamped as confidently as the rest.

  the wrong recording   A search for one Lex Fridman episode returned the
                        original and a channel called "Game Time" hosting
                        an identical 1,965-second copy. Ingest the copy and
                        the archive holds a re-upload it cannot tell from
                        the source, cited just as precisely.

Neither is hypothetical and neither announces itself downstream: a
fabricated line and a real one are the same shape by the time they reach
retrieval.

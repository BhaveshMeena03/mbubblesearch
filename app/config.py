    # things. Sonnet put it under Avoid, and also caught marketplace and
    # x402, which Haiku missed entirely. On another question Sonnet noticed
    # the docs state the MCP tool count three different ways and said so,

    #
    # This is the ONLY thing bounding spend against a slow drain. The global

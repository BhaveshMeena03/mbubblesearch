# Half the archive is X broadcasts, and about half of each one never
# reaches the YouTube upload — so for those minutes a rendered clip is the
# only copy of the moment that exists anywhere. That is why this renders
# at the quality of a clip cut by hand rather than a preview.
#
# It used to say the reason was that X cannot link to a timestamp. It can:
# the broadcast player seeks on ?t=<seconds>.
#
# The cost of that is real: ~2.2 CPU-seconds per second of output, one
# encode at a time. So the limiter here is deliberately far tighter than
# the one on search, and it is per-IP rather than global, because the
# failure being prevented is one person queueing thirty clips.

# Three an hour. A person clipping a moment they just found does it once or
# twice; thirty in a row is a script.

"""Spell the names right, even when the captions do not.

Whisper mishears the words this archive is most about. Measured across
every transcript:

    Solana      → "Salana"        430 of 1,131   (39%)
    Polymarket  → "poly market"   151 of 268     (56%)
    Hyperliquid → "Hyperlid"      149, plus "hyper liquid" 80  (54%)
    pump.fun    → "pumpfun"        43 of 44      (98%)
    friend.tech → "Frentech"       14 of 14     (100%)
    Mt Gox      → "Mount Gox"       9 of 9      (100%)

Two consequences, and the second is the one people see.

Retrieval mostly survives it -- the embeddings match on meaning, which is
why a search for "friend.tech" finds "Frentech" and a search for Mt Gox
found "Mount Gox". What cannot survive it is the exact-token index, which
matches letters and so has holes in precisely the places Whisper failed.

And when the model quotes a mangled line, the error goes out under a real
person's name: "Hyperlid briefly flipped Salana price" was posted as
FaZe Banks' words. He said Hyperliquid and Solana. Reproducing the
transcription error IS the misquote, so correcting it is the faithful
thing rather than the liberty.

Only unambiguous manglings are here. "per" is 170 hits and almost always
the English word rather than PURR; "Seoul" is 13 hits and a real city as
often as it is SOL. Both are left alone -- a wrong correction is worse
than an uncorrected error, because it is one this code chose.

"""An answer must not open by denying what it goes on to say.

    "I couldn't find that in the archive. The excerpts
     mention Michael Cat repeatedly — described as the head of
     production at Market Bubble around 3:05."

Both halves went out. A reader on X takes the first line and scrolls, so
a reply that worked reads as a tool that did not -- and that is the reply
somebody screenshots when they are deciding whether this is worth
anything.

Rule 1a was aimed at this twice: once as a principle, then rewritten as a
mechanic listing the forbidden openings verbatim. It moved 4-in-15 to
2-in-15 and stopped there. Everything else that resisted the prompt this
way -- the joke pool, model-written links, quotes credited to the wrong
host -- ended up in code.

The two directions matter equally. A real refusal cites nothing and must
survive whole, because "I couldn't find that in the episodes I've
indexed" is the honest answer to a question the archive cannot answer,
and it is most of what keeps this account trustworthy.

"""Do not open by saying you found nothing, then find it.

    "I couldn't find a detailed introduction to Michael Cat in these
     episodes, but from context he appears to be the head of production
     at Market Bubble.

     Around 5:01 ... one of the hosts describes him as 'our head of
     production' and says 'He does 80 different jobs.'"

The answer is right. The first sentence says it is not, and on X that is
the only sentence most people read.

Rule 1a was written at this twice -- once as a principle, then again as a
mechanic listing the forbidden openings verbatim. It went from four in
fifteen to two and stopped there. Attribution went the same way until it
moved out of the prompt and into code, so this does too.

A genuine refusal is untouched, and the test is not what the sentence
says: it is whether the reply goes on to cite a moment. With nothing
cited, "I couldn't find that" is the honest answer and the whole reply.

"""The X mention bot: what it says, what it refuses, and what it spends.

Two things here are worth more than the rest. The link guard, because a URL
in a reply costs 13x and X does not document what counts as one. And the
cold-start behaviour, because a bot that wakes up with no state and answers
a month of old mentions at once is the pattern that gets accounts
suspended — the failure is reputational and not reversible.

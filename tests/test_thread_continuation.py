"""Do not answer a conversation the account is merely standing in.

X carries a participant's handle into every subsequent reply in a
thread. Once this account has answered once, every message between two
other people arrives with @mbubbleSearch in the mention prefix, looking
exactly like a fresh summons.

    "@TheGreatCattsby @mbubbleSearch 🤣😂 it only answers from what was
     said on the broadcast sorry 😅"

That was an aside between two friends. It got "I couldn't find that in
the episodes I've indexed" posted underneath it, in public, on a thread
that had nothing to do with the archive.

An auto-carried mention cannot be distinguished from a typed one -- both
arrive as the handle in the text -- so the tie is broken on the ANSWER
instead. A miss is a good reply to a real question and a bad one to
somebody's joke, so in a thread already answered the miss is swallowed.
A follow-up that actually finds something still posts.

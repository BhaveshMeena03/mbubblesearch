"""What has to happen when an episode arrives, and used not to.

Market Bubble #17 went up on a Saturday. The sync ran that morning at
ten, hours before the upload, and was next scheduled for the following
Friday -- so the newest episode would have been invisible for six days
while the account told people it was not indexed.

Two failures underneath that, both of which would have repeated:

The show was ALREADY there. It had gone out as a live broadcast two days
earlier under the title "$100K POLYMARKET FANTASY FOOTBALL DRAFT NIGHT",
transcribed in full and searchable. Nobody could reach it by number,
because the number is read out of the title and that title had none.

And an episode ingested without the speaker pipeline is anonymous. It is
searchable, so nothing looks broken, but "what did Banks say" degrades to
"one of the hosts" on the one episode people are asking about.

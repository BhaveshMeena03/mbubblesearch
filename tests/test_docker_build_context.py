"""The Dockerfile and .dockerignore have to agree.

This is here because they disagreed, and nothing caught it. A COPY was
added for a file inside a directory .dockerignore excluded. Docker does
not warn and carry on — the build fails outright — and on Render a failed
build means the previous container keeps serving. So the URL stayed up,
/healthz stayed green, and the bot stopped answering for twenty minutes
with no signal anywhere that a deploy had failed.

A build would catch it, but a build needs Docker running and takes
minutes. This reads the two files and takes milliseconds, so it runs on
every commit instead of on the ones where someone remembered.

"""Show the model both the deep pool's answer and the shallow pool's.

Reranking fifty candidates reaches passages that reranking twelve cannot
-- the line naming who sold their entire ETH position sits at rank 44 --
but reranking fifty *alone* loses answers twelve got right, because
positions two to six fill with passages merely about the same subject
and evict the specific one.

Sequencing the two is a no-op and that was measured, not assumed:
reranking is a total order, so narrowing fifty to twelve and reranking
those twelve hands back the same six. Combining them is what changes
anything, because then neither set has to win the same slots.

Across a hundred questions: three misattributions at twelve, two at
fifty, none at the union, with the best recall of the three.

The invariant that matters here is that every passage the model reads
comes back in the response. The reply builder resolves a cited timestamp
by scanning the returned hits for the episode that contains it; a
passage the model quoted but the caller never saw sends the link to
whatever ranked first instead, which is how a true sentence ended up
welded to an unrelated episode once already.

"""Spell the names right, even when the captions do not.

Whisper mishears the words this archive is most about. Counted across
every transcript: "Salana" for Solana 430 times of 1,131, "poly market"
151 of 268, "Hyperlid" plus "hyper liquid" 229 of 526, "pumpfun" 43 of
44, "Frentech" and "Mount Gox" every single time.

Two consequences, and the second is the one people see.

The exact-token index matches letters, so it has holes exactly where the
captions do -- a lookup for "solana" cannot see four hundred lines that
say "Salana". The embeddings bridge that on their own, which is why a
search for friend.tech found "Frentech"; the term index cannot.

And a quoted mangling goes out under a real person's name. "Hyperlid
briefly flipped Salana price" was posted as FaZe Banks' words. He said
Hyperliquid and Solana, so reproducing the transcription error IS the
misquote, and correcting it is the faithful thing rather than a liberty.

What is deliberately NOT corrected matters as much. "per" appears 170
times and is almost always the English word rather than PURR; "Seoul" 13
times and is a city as often as it is SOL; "JTO" is Jito's actual
ticker. A wrong correction is worse than an uncorrected error, because
it is one this code chose.

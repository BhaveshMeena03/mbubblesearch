"""The way back from a proxy, without a deploy.

The podcast search can be pointed at an inference proxy — usepod routes
the same claude-haiku-4-5 at $0.40/$2.00 against Anthropic's $1.00/$5.00,
and settles in USDC, which is the whole reason to bother: topping up a
balance with a card is the thing that actually stops work here.

Everything about that arrangement is somebody else's uptime. A balance
runs out, a token is revoked, a marketplace goes quiet — and every one of
those looks, to a person typing a question, like the site being broken.
So the fallback is not a setting to flip when that happens; it is already
holding the real key and takes over on the failing request.

Two things this pins:

  the real key never goes to the proxy. usepod authenticates by a token
  in the URL path and ignores the header, so sending it would hand a
  third party a working Anthropic key for no benefit at all.

  a lookalike host is not Anthropic. "api.anthropic.com" is a substring
  of api.anthropic.com.evil.example, and a substring test would send the
  key straight there.

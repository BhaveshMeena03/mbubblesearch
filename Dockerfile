# ffmpeg and the DejaVu fonts, for the clip renderer. The slim image has
# neither: without ffmpeg the clip endpoints answer 503, and without a
# TrueType font Pillow silently falls back to a bitmap default and the
# burned-in captions come out looking broken rather than plain.
# --no-install-recommends keeps this to what is actually needed.

# A JavaScript runtime, for YouTube and nothing else.
#
# YouTube answers a download request with a JavaScript challenge, and
# yt-dlp has to execute it to derive the signature on the media URL. With
# no runtime present it cannot, and every attempt fails with "The page
# needs to be reloaded" -- a message that names neither JavaScript nor the
# missing dependency, which is why this took four rounds of chasing
# proxies and player clients to find.
#
# It is also exactly why every client worked on a laptop and none worked
# here: a developer machine has node or deno installed for other reasons,
# and this image had neither. The environments differed in a way nothing
# in the logs pointed at.
#
# Deno rather than node because it is the runtime yt-dlp supports for this,
# it is a single static binary, and it needs no package manager at
# runtime. Pinned, because "latest" makes the image non-reproducible and
# hands a third party the ability to change what ships here.

# episodes.json IS read at runtime now, by the clipper: it is the only
# place the source URL and the per-second segments live, and captions are
# built from those rather than from a fresh transcription. 7MB, parsed
# lazily on the first clip anyone asks for. Retrieval still goes to
# Pinecone and does not touch this.
# Gzipped: the raw file is 7.3MB and every ingest rewrites it, so it stays
# out of git and this 2.3MB copy ships instead. Regenerate it after an
# ingest with scripts/pack_episodes.py, or newly added episodes cannot be
# clipped (they 404 — nothing else is affected).

# come back from Pinecone with their text, and only the shelf is
